# About
Built a very minimalistic responsive portfolio website where I showcased my skills, expereince and Projects. 

## Project Section
- This is the only part in this website where it will fetch data and show github pinned repo's. 
- The reason why this part is dynamic because I wanted to update the project section as I am making changes in GitHub. [https://spacejelly.dev/posts/how-to-use-the-github-graphql-api-to-add-your-pinned-repositories-in-next-js-react/#what-is-the-github-graphql-api] 
- This Article demonstrated how can I get all the pinne'd repo's by GitHub GraphQL API.
